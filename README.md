<p style="font-family: monospace;"> Seriously. Love it. In the mid 90's I would bike to the local public libaray and jump on Netscape Navigator to edit my handful of GeoCities sites about dragons, or Bruce Lee, or DragonBall-Z... looking back, I guess they were all some combination of large reptiles and martial arts. 

<br>

Since then I have worked as a freelance musician (playing drums/percussion for many events and productions throughout Washington), and I spent 15 years in retail facilities maintenance (started cleaning toilets overnight, ended up leading multiple teams over several locations). But, throughout it all, I was drawn to <b><em>solving problems</em></b> and <b><em>writing code</em></b>.

<br>

I graduated form the <b>University of Washington Coding Bootcamp</b> in May 2020, and have been working to expand my knowledge base every day since! 
Currently, I work as a TA for the same bootcamp and have discovered a new love for teaching!

The parents of children with hearing impairment often receive stacks of data and information that does nothing to help them understand what their child is hearing in the world around them. This (as-yet-unnamed) application aims to help these parents by interpreting all that data and outputing filtered audio files - showing an approximation of what their child hears.
